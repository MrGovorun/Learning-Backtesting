# Learning Backtesting
This is my learning notes about testing trading strategy with Backtesting library. Main structure of notebook:   
1. Load data from Binance (not API token need) with 1 minute frame
2. Write data with Pandas in SQLite DB
3. Write functions for testing, validate, convert timeframe (used SMA)
4. Get top-3 backtesting stocks and validate its result on other data part
5. Test different timeframe on data for best strategy result
